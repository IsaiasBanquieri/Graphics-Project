# Graphics-Project
This is a computer graphics project to display an environmental lake with 3D house, animated boat &amp; sun, keyboard controlled fish and many more objects which i have made for my course. CodeBlocks IDE, OpenGL programming  &amp; C++ programming language are used to build the project "Environmental Lake"
To run this project you need to add OpenGL's ancillary program to your CodeBlocks IDE. After that just need to open the cbp file with CodeBlocks.
